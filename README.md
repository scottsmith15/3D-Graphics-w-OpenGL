# How do I approach designing software?
To successfully create a fully realized 3D world using OpenGL, I needed to break down the entire development process into smaller components and plan out achievable goals within strict time limitations.  Though the goal of the implementation was realized very early on, I certainly applied a more adaptive design process throughout the development.  Working with new libraries is always challenging.  By first creating simple shapes and strengthening my understanding of the rendering pipeline, I was able to exercise this knowledge and apply it at a larger scale later during development by expanding the project based upon a modular design.  By remaining focused on the smaller challenges and tasks, I was able to weave together several individual concepts and components that I held very little understanding of just a few weeks prior.  Larger scale projects can be intimidating at first, but I will strive to apply the skills and awareness that Iâ€™ve practiced throughout this course to assist me in all future endeavors.       
# How do I approach developing programs?
Developing my 3D scene within strict time limitations demanded that I make use of a modular design.  Many of the tasks required to generate a 3D scene can become repetitive.  There are often many different shapes that need to be drawn which may have their own unique texture and/or require the use of light reflections.  In the end, this will amount to a huge code base.  To be able to write code that would be intuitive, logical, and readable, I focused primarily on iterating my modular design.  All objects were created as similar but independent meshes, assigned textures redundantly, then manipulated about the 3D scene and drawn in an identical pattern throughout the rendering pipeline.  In the beginning of development, I focused primarily on creating these objects and functions to streamline later iterations.  New concepts such as lighting had to be learned and applied, but by starting with a basic modular design and a deep understanding of each individual component, the process became very much like plug and play.   
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
I believe that having a strong understanding of computational graphics and visualizations will make me a stronger student and candidate for future employers.  User interfaces and user experiences are becoming more and more demanding, and the application of realistic 3D models can benefit nearly all industries.  It will be one thing to say that I understand HTML and can do some back-end infrastructure with your data, but to have an almost whimsical control of the front-end user experience will be a game changer.  Whether we think of modern video games, medical education, VR military training, or other possibilities that can only be realized using augmented reality, we are constantly expanding our capabilities through technological revelations.  Starting with OpenGL, I will be well-equipped to take on and maybe even push the envelope for the technology of the future.
